## Project description
```
Provides a user interface for an interactive Tic Tac Toe app. This game supports multi-browser 1 on 1 game.

Functionalities: Start game, join game, restart game.

Help for local testing: After starting both the client and server applications, go to the main page and click on `Start Game` button to initialize a game. Then open a second browser tab, go again to the main page and click on 'Join Game' to join the previously initialized game. At this point an interactive game can be played. After a player wins - or it's a draw - the game will automatically delete itself, and a new game can be started.

Suggestion: Don't close browser tabs.
